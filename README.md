Billing-System
==============

An in-house billing system for a VoIP Company.

This system was written when I first started learning PHP and JavaScript so some of the code is old.  For example, its generally better practice to use object oriented style mysqli when writing PHP but the code in this project uses mysql_* functions.

To summarize this project, I will begin with the company.  Qloog is a VoIP servies company whos main business is renting out VoIP lines via Asterisk to its clients.  The clients are primarily call centers ranging from 50 to about 300 seats.  The volume of calls coming into the servers was quite high and I was charged with organizing and filtering the call logs and displaying the information in a user-friendly web interface.  The primary languages of this project are PHP, JavaScript (jQuery), HTML, CSS, and MySQL along with some Bash scripting.
